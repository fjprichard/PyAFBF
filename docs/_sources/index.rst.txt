**********************************
Welcome to PyAFBF's documentation!
**********************************

The Package PyAFBF is intended for the simulation of rough anisotropic image textures. Textures are sampled from a mathematical model called the anisotropic fractional Brownian field. Some texture examples are shown below on the patchwork.

.. note::

	The anisotropic fractional Brownian field was introduced in :cite:p:`Bonami2003` and further studied in several works
	:cite:p:`Bierme08-ESAIM,Richard-2017,Richard-2016,Richard-2015b,Richard-2015,Richard-2010,Vu2020`. It was applied for the modeling 	and the analysis of medical images :cite:p:`Bierme10-Springer,Bierme09-ESAIM,Richard-2010,Richard-2015b,Richard-2016` or 		photographic films :cite:p:`Richard-2017` . The simulation method was designed in :cite:`Bierme-2015-TBM`.

Package features
================

- Simulation of rough anisotropic textures,

- Computation of field features (semi-variogram, regularity, anisotropy indices) that can serve as texture attributes,

- Random definition of simulated fields,

- Extensions to related fields (deformed fields, intrinsic fields, heterogeneous fields, binary patterns).

- (NEW FEATURE - version >= 0.2.4) Generate database of rough anisotropic textures with the complementary package `PyAFBFdb <https://github.com/fjprichard/PyAFBFdb>`_.

- (COMING SOON) Example-based simulation.


Installation
============

The package source can be downloaded from the `repository <https://github.com/fjprichard/PyAFBF>`_. 

The package can also be installed through PyPI with

.. code-block:: python

    pip install PyAFBF
