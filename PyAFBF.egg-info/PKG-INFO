Description: The Package PyAFBF is intended for the simulation of rough anisotropic image textures. Textures are sampled from a mathematical model called the anisotropic fractional Brownian field. More details can be found on the `documentation <https://fjprichard.github.io/PyAFBF/>`_.
        
        Package features
        ================
        
        - Simulation of rough anisotropic textures,
        
        - Computation of field features (semi-variogram, regularity, anisotropy indices) that can serve as texture attributes,
        
        - Random definition of simulated fields,
        
        - Extensions to related fields (deformed fields, intrinsic fields, heterogeneous fields, binary patterns).
        
        
        Installation from sources
        =========================
        
        The package source can be downloaded from the `repository <https://github.com/fjprichard/PyAFBF>`_. 
        
        To install the package, write the following commands in the root directory where the package was downloaded:
        
            python setup.py install
            or
            pip install -e .
        
        After installation, the package can be tested by running 
        
            python tests/TestAll.py
        
        If no output appears, then the package is correctly installed.
