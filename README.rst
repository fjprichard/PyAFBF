The Package PyAFBF is intended for the simulation of rough anisotropic image textures. Textures are sampled from a mathematical model called the anisotropic fractional Brownian field. More details can be found on the `documentation <https://fjprichard.github.io/PyAFBF/>`_.

Package features
================

- Simulation of rough anisotropic textures,

- Computation of field features (semi-variogram, regularity, anisotropy indices) that can serve as texture attributes,

- Random definition of simulated fields,

- Extensions to related fields (deformed fields, intrinsic fields, heterogeneous fields, binary patterns).


Installation from sources
=========================

The package source can be downloaded from the `repository <https://github.com/fjprichard/PyAFBF>`_. 

The package can be installed through PYPI with
 
 pip install PyAFBF
 
To install the package in a Google Collab environment, please type

 !pip install imgaug==0.2.6
 
 !pip install PyAFBF
